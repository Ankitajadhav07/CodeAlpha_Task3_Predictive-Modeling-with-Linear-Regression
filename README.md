## Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression

This repository contains a comprehensive example of predictive modeling using linear regression to predict house prices based on various features. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building, evaluating, and interpreting a linear regression model. 

### Project Overview

The objective of this project is to predict house prices using a linear regression model. The dataset includes features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, lot area, and others. The process involves training a model, making predictions, and evaluating its performance.

### Key Features

- **Data Preparation:** The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and prepare features for modeling.
- **Model Training:** A Linear Regression model is trained using the training dataset.
- **Prediction:** The trained model is used to make predictions on the test dataset.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Performance is assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) scores.
- **Visualization:** Various plots are generated to visualize model performance and feature importance, including:
  - Actual vs. Predicted Prices
  - Residual Plot
  - Feature Importance based on Coefficients
  - Correlation Matrix Heatmap
  - Distribution Plot of the Target Variable
  - Pair Plot of Selected Features

### Files and Folders

- `linear_regression_model.py`: The main script that includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the project.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for modeling.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis and additional visualizations.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linear-regression-model.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Model:**
   Execute the `linear_regression_model.py` script to train the model and generate the results:
   ```bash
   python linear_regression_model.py
   ```

### Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated based on:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
- **R-squared (R²):** Represents the proportion of variance explained by the model.
